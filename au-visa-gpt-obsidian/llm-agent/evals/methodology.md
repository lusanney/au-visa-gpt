# Evals — Methodology

Goals:
- Measure citation accuracy, abstain rate, and task success on representative questions and docs.

Setup:
- Small gold set (10–20 Q&A) with authoritative citations.
- 2–3 redacted documents with expected checklists/extractions.

Process:
- Run after corpus updates; compare against prior results.
- Investigate regressions; adjust retrieval/prompting as needed.

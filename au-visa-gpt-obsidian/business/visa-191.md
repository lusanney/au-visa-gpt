# Visa 191 â€” Business Context

TL;DR:
- Pathway for certain provisional visa holders to obtain permanent residency (high-level summary).

Scope for our assistant:
- Provide citations to Migration Act/Regs sections relevant to 191 eligibility.
- Generate checklists based on user documents (income years, employment continuity, residency indicators).
- Recommend additional documents from a case officer perspective when evidence is missing/weak (e.g., extra payslips, employment letters, bank statements).

Not legal advice:
- We provide information with citations and dates; abstain when not confident.

Data handling:
- PII in uploads stays local; redact in logs; retention configurable.
